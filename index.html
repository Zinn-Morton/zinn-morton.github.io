                        <p>I'm a Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University with a focus in AI. I was the project leader for my team's machine learning R&D-based capstone project. There, I managed our sprints, workload division, and communication with the company, TAs, and professors. I also worked as a member of the team and implemented and applied some anomaly detection algorithms to the data we received. I am working to progress my career and add new tools to my toolkit. I am currently learning React and ExpressJS.</p>

                        As a math tutor, I assisted and guided students in solving their homework problems. First, I reviewed the question with the student and made sure their understanding of the problem was correct. Then I would check their work step by step with the student and ask them to explain their thought process. After this, I was able to gain a good understanding of where their gaps in knowledge were. Once I understood this, I was able to point out where the mistake was in a personalized way in accordance to their knowledge. I would then do another short example problem with the
                        student to make sure they understood. Additionally, I would bring to the student's attention edge cases where the approach we took may not work. As part of this work I received College Reading and Learning Association tutor certification.

The topics in this class were largely directed by the students' interests. Throughout the course, I gained an intuition of what each student would like to learn. Additionally, I introduced new topics in a fun way that would keep the students interested, as I believe that it is crucial for the educators of the next generation to teach in a way that keeps students truly engaged.</p>

The site features a system that allows users to make an account to view, create, edit, and delete their set of tasks. I implemented authentication middleware on the backend utilizing json web tokens and made use of password hashing to avoid storing user passwords on the database. I also implemented numerous user quality of life features such as a stylized and responsive css layout and detailed error messages.</p>

                            <p>
                                During my capstone project, I was the project leader for a team of 5 students working to detect anomalies in time-series data from a metal remelting crucible. As the project leader, I divided sprint tasks, scheduled the project timeline, and served as the fundamental communication point between the team, Ampere Scientific, and other work partners. Additionally, I researched an implemented anomaly detection algorithms such as Cusum, Control Chart, and Autoregression. I led my team to create a prototype with anomaly detection methods and visualization for these
                                methods that can serve as a basis for future development. You can view my work on my aforementioned capstone project here under "Zinn Tests." Feel free to look at the documentation for more detail on the methods I implemented and their results.
